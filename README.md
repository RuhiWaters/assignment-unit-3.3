# Unit 3, Part 3 - Parts Supply

This unit, we will continue to put more into your tool belt by tackling methods for handling tasks multiple times, storing multiple pieces of information, and more advanced decision tools.

## Topics Covered

* Loops `for`, `while`, `for of`
* Arrays

## Assignment

As always, start off by forking and cloning this repository from GitHub. Open the code up in Atom to get started. 

> Note that in the future we will not call this out explicitly. We'll assume you already know that is how you start your work. 

### Reminder - Levels of Difficulty

- Required Features are required and focus on the key skills for the week
- Stretch Goals are __*optional*__!
  - These will stretch and challenge deeper understanding of the material.
  - Note that these may require additional research beyond the provided content. 

### Files Provided

- *index.html* (Note: JS & CSS files are already sourced)
- *style.css*
- *part-supply.js* (Contains **required features** and stretch goals)

This part of the assignment will mix more of the array and loop content with more of the material from earlier weeks. Again, there are comments with instructions for completing each task.

> Please do not remove the instruction comments as you complete your work. 


Optionally, you may also write any remaining questions you have for the week in the HTML file.
